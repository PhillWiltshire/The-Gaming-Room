# The-Gaming-Room
This was a project form CS 230 in which we devolved a design for a software application based on a clients request.

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client in this scenario was a company called The Gaming Room. They were interested in taking their already successful game to a web-based platform. They already had the game running
on Android devices, but wanted to expand their reach to other platforms. The software needed to be web-accessible, allow team participation, create unique names for games and teams, have single instance limiations and unique identifies, and a few other gameplay requirements.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I enjoyed thinking through and working on this process. It took some time to look up and figure out all of the different options and the portion where we were just listing those out was
the toughest for me. Once I was able to look at all the information and make the recomendations, that is where I thought my project came together well. I think that I was able to effectively lay
out my argument and piece together the important aspects of the information that would me the most useful for the client.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I think this may be the obvious anser, but having the UML diagram and deveolping the domain model were extremely helpful steps when talking about the pure design of the code. Also, having to 
take the time to think about the start, middle, and ending portions of what the client would want made the design of the code start to become more 'real'. Essentially I think that just
spending more time engaged with the problem from the perspective of the client helps in the deveolpment of the code.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I already took the time to improve the parts of the project that my instructor gave me feedback on. The evaluation portion was where I had to make the most corrections. Originally I had a hard time with the pricing and development tools portion of the evaluation. This was my first class where we were introduced to the different tools that we could use. That made this portion take the longest and originally I wasn't sure how everything interacted together. After the feedback I was able to adjust this portion and focus more on how the different tools would hinder or help the dev team.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
When designing the software for Draw It or Lose It, I interpreted user needs by focusing on functionality, scalability, and a seamless user experience. The target users—teams competing in a multiplayer, web-based environment—needed features like real-time gameplay, unique identifiers for teams and players, and efficient management of time-sensitive rounds. I translated these needs into practical design decisions, such as implementing a centralized cloud-based platform for real-time interactions and incorporating secure mechanisms for player authentication and data storage.
Considering user needs is essential because it ensures the software aligns with their expectations and enhances their experience. For instance, ignoring the importance of latency in a real-time game would significantly hinder the user experience, making the application less engaging or even frustrating. Designing with the user in mind improves adoption rates and reduces costly redesigns later in development.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My approach to designing this software started with analyzing the functional requirements and mapping them to appropriate architectural solutions. I used techniques like microservices architecture to allow modular development and scaling. For example, separate services were defined for authentication, gameplay logic, and leaderboards, ensuring each could be independently optimized and scaled. I also employed tools like containerization for resource management and caching solutions to enhance responsiveness during gameplay.
For future projects, I would emphasize tools like automated monitoring for security and performance, ensuring the application remains robust under variable demands. Agile methodologies would continue to guide my approach, enabling flexibility and adaptability in responding to evolving user requirements. By maintaining a focus on user-centric design and leveraging scalable, secure solutions, I can ensure that the final product meets both current needs and future demands effectively.
